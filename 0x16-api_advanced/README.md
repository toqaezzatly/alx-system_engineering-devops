# Reddit API Example

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to interact with the Reddit API to fetch information about subreddits. Specifically, it provides a Python function to retrieve the number of subscribers for a given subreddit. 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)

## API Endpoint

The function queries the following Reddit API endpoint:

```
https://www.reddit.com/r/{subreddit}/about.json
```

Where `{subreddit}` should be replaced with the name of the subreddit you wish to query.

## Function

### `number_of_subscribers(subreddit)`

This function takes a single argument, `subreddit`, which is a string representing the name of the subreddit you want to get information about. 

#### Arguments

- `subreddit` (str): The name of the subreddit.

#### Returns

- `int`: The number of subscribers to the subreddit, or `0` if the subreddit is invalid or an error occurs.

#### Example Usage

```python
from your_module import number_of_subscribers

subreddit = 'programming'
print(f'Number of subscribers: {number_of_subscribers(subreddit)}')

subreddit = 'this_is_a_fake_subreddit'
print(f'Number of subscribers: {number_of_subscribers(subreddit)}')
```

### Error Handling

- If the subreddit does not exist or the request fails, the function will return `0`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reddit-api-example.git
   cd reddit-api-example
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Use the function as demonstrated in the example above to get the number of subscribers for any subreddit.

## Notes

- A custom `User-Agent` is used in the requests to avoid being blocked by Reddit for making too many requests.
- The function handles errors gracefully by returning `0` for invalid subreddits or failed requests.
